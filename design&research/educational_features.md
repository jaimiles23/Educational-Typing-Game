# Educational features
Ideas for general educational features to include in the game.


## Scaffolding
The game difficulty should scaffolding to increase the difficulty based on the user's ability.

Scaffolding options may include:
-  **Survival Mode**: 
   -  Starts out easy and gets harder & harder. 
   -  Users can set records for how long they survived.
   -  multiplayer? 
      -  Teams vs one another?
      -  Allow lobbies with disproportionate teams.
-  **Self-Selection**: 
   -  Users can select their own level of difficulty
-  **Track Progress**: 
   -  Users create a profile and the game tracks their progress.
   -  Game will design custom challenges based on their ability.
   -  Initial profile _may_ consider a typing test to estimate their placement. This is done well by [typingclub](https://www.typingclub.com/sportal/program-3.placement). However, the placement test should be shorter. Can add initial high user variability (reference ELO ratings).


## Touch Typing
This game should include an option for users to practice their touch typing. There may be modes/tutorials to practice touch typing.

For instance, a mode to practice specific fingers.  [typingclub](https://www.typingclub.com/sportal/program-3.placement) contains practices for specific fingers that can be referenced.

*Note*: Should eventually be responsive to keyboard layout.


## Custom practices
This game should track user metrics and design customized practices. 

**Metrics** may include:
- Input time, e.g., how long it takes a user to perform a specific stroke
- Number of times users misspell a word/what kind of misspelling it is.
  - will be computationally heavy
- Mean Time to Word Resolution since appeared on screen

*Note*: May only like to analyze user data from last X days, so referencing most recent data (like with Multiplication Medley).

**Customized practices** may include:
- words that users mess up the most frequently.
- common types of misspellings, e.g., i before e
- letters that users are slower to input
- words that are longer than mean word length typed
