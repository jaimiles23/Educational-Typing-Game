# Activity Ideas
Contains ideas for potential game activities. This game may contain several different typing modes or focus on a single game type.

Activities ideas may include:
- Short description
- Detailed description
- Graphic description?
- Auxiliary features
- Other ideas to explore
- Relevant training/education concepts


## Survival Mode
> Name pending


### Short description
Users are challenged to defend their lives against an onslaught of words.


### Detailed description
> concept still in brainstorm

A map is generated with X fruit in the middle. Users are tasked to defend their fruit from animals coming to eat (steal) it. Animals spawn with a 'word' value and move towards the fruit. The user may 'pop' the animal off the map by correctly typing the word value above its head. When an animal reaches the fruit, the animal picks it up and carries it off the map. When an animal is popped off the map while carrying a fruit, the fruit will land in the animal's previous position. The game is over when the animals steal all of the user's fruit.


### Auxiliary features:
- RNG map. Creates random pathways and chokepoints for replayability.
- Creates may spawn from periphery or generated areas.
- May consider 1 or 3 fruits. Or varying fruit with difficulty.
- Animals will spawn with increasing frequency & difficulty
- Animals may have different characteristics:
  - move speed, special traits, etc.
- Possibility for multi-player:
  - Can have the same map generated side by side and competition to survive longer.
  - Can have multiple teams spawn on the same map, with different colors animals for each team. This may increase chaos/fun.


### Thoughts
- Path finding algorithm
- May be too computationally complex for python?
- Multi-player may definitely lag?
  - may be OK for players to have stronger computer to play multiplayer?
